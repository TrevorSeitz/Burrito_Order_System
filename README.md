Sinatra Burrito Ordering App

This app provides a database and web interface for users to:

Create an account to order burritos from Sam's Burritos.  This is not intended to be a full webstore product, but only and ordering system.  It is a sample only. 

The Admin - Sam - can offer more burritos and add them to the list but no other user can.

All other users can create an order for burritos, they can edit or cancel(delete) their order before it is submitted and see thier order history. 

This app was built with Sinatra, extended with Rake tasks for working with an SQL database using ActiveRecord ORM.
